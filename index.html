				<h1>The 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Vehicular Networks (IWAIVN 2021)</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with 18th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2021)</h2>
				<h2>October 4-7, 2021, Denver, CO, USA</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<hr class="style17">

				<br>
					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>  Recent rapid advances in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, Wireless Networks, and Sensor Devices have introduced Vehicular Network as an interesting topic to the research community, one that has received much attention from practitioners, scholars, and the public. The Vehicular Network, also known as Inter-Vehicle Communication Network, focuses on the spontaneous creation of a wireless communication network among vehicles, and further providing better transportation for users. Considering that we are in the era of Intelligence, many technologies and applications emerge to develop a more sustainable, efficient, and safe transportation system, such as smart traffic management systems and autonomous car systems. However, there are still many open research problems in this field, such as security and privacy issues during the data communication, green vehicle routing, and the integration of sensors, vehicular network, data center, and the existing transportation systems. To this end, this workshop aims to create a platform for scholars, industry professionals, and government officials to discuss and share new research idea and technologies in the Vehicular Network and its applications. </p>
